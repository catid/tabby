For the TabbyPAKE paper I made a mistake in the 2.2 Background section:

"Despite the assurances made by the AugPAKE authors it is not possible to implement AugPAKE using elliptic
curve math."

Sorry it turns out I was wrong about that - It works just fine.  In fact the simplicity of AugPAKE is attractive when implemented with elliptic curves.
