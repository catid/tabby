		// Tabby's approach offers a higher security level, which makes
		// up for the "security level bits" lost by using an efficient
		// endomorphism to speed up curve math, and is not much slower
		// in practice (<2% overhead) than masking.  And key generation
		// is rarely a bottleneck in practice.

		// Using keys uniformly distributed in 1..q-1 is important
		// for Tabby because later on the private keys are combined as
		// `k = k1 * H + k2` similar to EdDSA.  If k1 or k2 are biased
		// due to masking bits, then the resulting value `k` has a
		// large bias according to some 18-bit simulations.  So to avoid
		// this problem, strong uniformly-distributed keys are used.
